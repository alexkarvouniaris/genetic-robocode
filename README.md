# Genetic Algorithm applied to Robocode

This project is about implementing the genetic algorithm to any robot(in this case SuperTracker) in Robocode, and make it to perform better so it wins a specific battle.

## Prerequisites

To make this run, first you have to download:

[Robocode](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/)

[JGAP Library](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jgap/)

## Getting Started

First, download the project and open it in the IDE of your choice. Then go to edit the Libraries, remove the existing jgap path and add your already downloaded jgap library.

### Robocode

Manually open Robocode.exe. Click Options --> Preferencies --> Developement Options. Then, add this project's path and click Finish. Now you have the two robots that we used for this specific example. 

## Run
Before running the ExecutableFile.java, edit the configurations, click in the Arguments tab, fill the VM Arguments tab with this statement: **-DNOSECURITY=true**, and then set the Working Directory with: **C:\robocode**. 
You are now ready to run the project. This will lead to the Robocode program to open also and you can witness the final battle.
